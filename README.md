# Video Objects Detector
This is a web applications that contains a computer vision model (InceptionV3).
It detects objects in the video and brings a drop down of detected classes based on predictions made by InceptionV3 pre-trained model.

To try it I uploaded it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, just upload your video that is less than 10MB on http://video-object-detector-app.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
